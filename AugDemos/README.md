# Augmentation of Demonstrations
In this part, we show how to condcut the point cloud-level geometry augmentation of manipulated objects of all valid demonstrations for each task.

## 0) Data download and environment configuration



## 1) Pre-processing of all valid demonstrations

## 2) Geometric transformation in point cloud-level
